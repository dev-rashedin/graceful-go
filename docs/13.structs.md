# Go Structs — Beginner-Friendly Guide

In Go, a **struct** (short for "structure") is a **composite data type** that allows you to store **multiple fields of different types** in a single variable. Structs are extremely useful for representing **real-world entities** like books, employees, or products.


## 1. What is a Struct?

- A struct is a **collection of fields**, each with its own **name** and **type**  
- Structs help **group related data** together under a single variable  
- They are like **blueprints** for creating objects with multiple attributes


## 2. Declaring a Struct

- Syntax:

```go
type StructName struct {
    Field1 Type1
    Field2 Type2
    Field3 Type3
}
```

- `type` keyword defines a new type  
- Each field has a **name** and a **data type**


## 3. Creating Struct Instances

- You can create an instance (object) of a struct using **struct literal**

```go
type Book struct {
    Title       string
    Author      string
    Subject     string
    BookId      int
    Price       float64
    AddedToCart bool
}

// Creating a book instance
book1 := Book{
    Title: "The Lord of the Rings",
    Author: "JRR Tolkien",
    Subject: "Fantasy",
    BookId: 123456,
    Price: 19.99,
    AddedToCart: true,
}
```


## 4. Accessing Struct Fields

- Use **dot notation** to access or modify fields of a struct

```go
fmt.Println("The title of the book is", book1.Title)         // Output: The title of the book is The Lord of the Rings
fmt.Println("The author of the book is", book1.Author)       // Output: The author of the book is JRR Tolkien
fmt.Println("The subject of the book is", book1.Subject)     // Output: The subject of the book is Fantasy
fmt.Println("The book id is", book1.BookId)                 // Output: The book id is 123456
fmt.Println("The price of the book is", book1.Price)         // Output: The price of the book is 19.99
fmt.Println("The book is added to cart", book1.AddedToCart)  // Output: The book is added to cart true
```

- You can also **modify** a field using dot notation:

```go
book1.Price = 24.99
fmt.Println("Updated price:", book1.Price) // Output: Updated price: 24.99
```


## 5. Key Points About Structs

- Structs can have **fields of any type** (int, float, bool, string, slices, other structs, etc.)  
- Structs allow you to **model real-world entities** in code  
- Struct fields can be **exported** (capitalized) or **unexported** (lowercase)  
- Structs can be **passed to functions by value** or by **pointer** for efficiency  


## 6. Example: Complete Struct Usage

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    type Book struct {
        Title       string
        Author      string
        Subject     string
        BookId      int
        Price       float64
        AddedToCart bool
    }

    book1 := Book{
        Title: "The Lord of the Rings",
        Author: "JRR Tolkien",
        Subject: "Fantasy",
        BookId: 123456,
        Price: 19.99,
        AddedToCart: true,
    }

    fmt.Println("Book Details:")
    fmt.Println("Title:", book1.Title)
    fmt.Println("Author:", book1.Author)
    fmt.Println("Subject:", book1.Subject)
    fmt.Println("Book ID:", book1.BookId)
    fmt.Println("Price:", book1.Price)
    fmt.Println("Added to Cart:", book1.AddedToCart)
}
```

> ⚠️ Tip: Use structs whenever you need to **group multiple related values** together. They are the foundation for creating more complex data types in Go, like **slices of structs, maps of structs, and nested structs**.
