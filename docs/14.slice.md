# Go Slices

In Go, a **slice** is a **flexible and dynamic data structure** that builds on arrays. Unlike arrays, slices can **grow and shrink in size**, making them more versatile. Slices are similar to **lists in Python** or **arrays in JavaScript**.

## 1. What is a Slice?

- A slice is a **sequence of elements of the same type**  
- Slices have **dynamic size**, unlike fixed-length arrays  
- They consist of a **pointer to an underlying array**, a **length**, and a **capacity**  


## 2. Declaring Slices

- You can declare slices in multiple ways:

```go
var numbers []int           // Declared but not initialized, nil slice
numbers2 := make([]int, 5) // Create slice of length 5, capacity 5
numbers3 := make([]int, 5, 10) // Length 5, capacity 10
```

- **len(slice)** gives the current number of elements  
- **cap(slice)** gives the capacity of the underlying array

```go
fmt.Println("Slice:", numbers3)
fmt.Println("Length:", len(numbers3))
fmt.Println("Capacity:", cap(numbers3))
```


## 3. Creating and Using Slices

- Slices can be **initialized with values**:

```go
numbers3 := []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

- You can create **sub-slices** (subslicing):

```go
fmt.Println(numbers3[3:8]) // Start index inclusive, end index exclusive
fmt.Println(numbers3[:3])  // Start from 0, up to index 3
fmt.Println(numbers3[4:])  // Start from index 4 to the end
```


## 4. Appending and Copying Slices

- Use **append()** to add elements to the end of a slice:

```go
new_numbers := make([]int, 5, 10)
new_numbers = append(new_numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
fmt.Println("After append:", new_numbers)
```

- Use **copy()** to copy elements from one slice to another:

```go
new_numbers_copy := make([]int, len(new_numbers), cap(new_numbers)*2)
copy(new_numbers_copy, new_numbers)
fmt.Println("After copy:", new_numbers_copy)
```


## 5. Nil Slice

- A slice that has not been initialized is called a **nil slice**:

```go
var nil_slice []int
fmt.Println("Nil slice:", nil_slice)
```

> ⚠️ Tip: Slices are more dynamic than arrays. Use slices when you need **resizable sequences** and want to perform operations like **append, copy, and subslicing**.
